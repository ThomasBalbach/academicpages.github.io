Before doing my <a href="https://soc.kuleuven.be/io/english/staff/00156277">PhD</a> at KU Leuven, I worked in the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasbalbach/">eGovernment industry</a> on various systems for various governments in various languages.

Because of that, I study how public administrations work together with contractors and how we can use text-as-data for Public Administration research.

My research focuses on:
- Public procurement, contracting out, public sector consulting 
- Language in public service delivery and encounters
- Digital government data as research data
- Public sector information infrastructures
